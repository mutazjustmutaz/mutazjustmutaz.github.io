<h2><a href="posts/fts-mixup.html">A Interesting Mix-Up in the Documentation of the fts Library</a></h2>

<p>In the C programming language, recursive directory traversal is provided by POSIX’s ftw library. But there’s also a popular non-POSIX library that provides the same service, which is fts. It originated in BSD, and was later adopted by Linux (via glibc) and macOS. </p>

<p>The fts library traverses a directory recursively and returns a struct for each file it encounters. The returned struct contains comprehensive information about the file, including the following properties:</p>
<pre>
char *fts_path;		     /*	root path */
size_t fts_pathlen;	     /*	strlen(fts_path) */
char *fts_name;		     /*	file name */
size_t fts_namelen;	     /*	strlen(fts_name) */
</pre>
<p>It’s important to note that this is taken from the <a href="https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=fts&sektion=3">FreeBSD documentation</a>. The fts_path property is described as the “root path”, but what it actually provides is the file’s full path. The long description contains the reason for this choice of words:</p>
<pre>
fts_path
              The path for the file relative to the root of the
              traversal.  This path contains the path specified to
              fts_open() as a prefix.
</pre>
<p>Generally, describing a path as root implies that it’s a directory. The BSD people chose to describe the full file path as “root” because of its relation to the path of the directory being traversed, which, in this context, is a root path.</p>
<p>As it happens, this BSD use of the word caused a mix-up to happen in the library’s <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/fts.3.html">GNU documentation</a>:</p>
<pre>
char           *fts_path;     /* root path */
short           fts_pathlen;  /* strlen(fts_path) +
                                                strlen(fts_name) */
char           *fts_name;     /* filename */
short           fts_namelen;  /* strlen(fts_name) */
</pre>
<p>Because fts_path is described as the “root path”, the writer thought that it represents the directory containing the file, and that led him to redefine fts_pathlen as the sum of the lengths of the fts_path and fts_name properties. This happened even though the GNU documentation’s long description is copied verbatim from the FreeBSD documentation:</p>
<pre>
fts_path
              The path for the file relative to the root of the
              traversal.  This path contains the path specified to
              fts_open() as a prefix.
</pre>
<p>This mistake happened because of a combination of BSD’s unconventional use of a technical term and the GNU writer’s failure to read (or comprehend) the relevant description. Another interesting observation to be made here is that the library’s documentation was written by someone who hasn’t actually worked with the library.</p>

<h2><a href="posts/ubuntu-upgrade.html">Jellyfish</a></h2>

<p>Every two years the time comes to upgrade my Ubuntu. I know that I’ll get Ubuntu’s most stable updates for the packages on my system, and I also know that the upgrade will break some of my packages and I’ll have to spend a couple of hours fixing them.</p>
<p>This year the upgrade is from 20.04 (Focal Fossa) to 22.04 (Jammy Jellyfish). A few days ago all the stars aligned and I decided that “[i]t’s time, Butch”. I rely on the command line to do upgrades, but when I, whilst performing due diligence, checked out Ubuntu’s official website I discovered that there was no mention at all of the command line - the tutorial was exclusively on the GUI client. I find this odd, but my guess is that it may be part of a push by Canonical to present Ubuntu to the masses as a mainstream OS. (Linux in general had always, with good reason, been more attractive to the techie/developer crowd than to average users.) I decided to put on my “average user” hat and use the GUI client, but it turned out that this year wasn’t meant to be the “Year of Linux on the Desktop”.</p>
 <p>I began by backing up my data and launching the GUI client. Then I clicked through the screens until I got to this one (image from online tutorial):<br><br>
<img alt="upgrade screen" src="../images/tutorial.png" width="75%"/><br><br>
When I clicked on the “Details” tab a text box containing the details appeared and the window expanded to accommodate it. The problem was that the expansion happened vertically in both directions, something which resulted in the title bar, with its controls for resizing/minimizing/closing/moving the window, disappearing beyond the top edge of the screen and the “Cancel” and “Start Upgrade” buttons below disappearing beneath the bottom edge. Clicking on the Details tab again doesn’t help because it makes the text box disappear without returning the window to its original state. 

This means that I’ve just lost all means of interacting with the window using the mouse, and if I opt to use the keyboard instead I’ll be working blind, with no way of verifying that the focus generated by the tab key was on the correct button. My setup is a VirtualBox virtual machine with the screen scaled to 100%, a typical platform with a typical configuration. A UI design failure of this type is unacceptable under any circumstances, but what makes this particular one egregious is that it occurs in a crucial application like the OS upgrade client, where pressing the wrong button can completely ruin your day.</p> 
<p>The only good thing about the situation is that it happened at an early stage in the process, where cancellation was still a viable option. I pressed the tab key once, thereby (hopefully) setting the focus on “Cancel”,  and  pressed “Enter”, which resulted in the cancellation of the upgrade process.</p> 
 <p>I sighed, put my techie hat back on, and returned to the good old command line.</p> 
<p>The command line upgrade process is simple and painless. But regardless of the upgrade method used, there will always be broken packages afterwards that have to be discovered and fixed. This time I discovered that the upgrade had broken crucial packages all along my web stack, namely Apache, MySQL, and phpMyAdmin. Moreover, I discovered that Emacs had been completely removed from the system.</p>
<p>I won’t go into the details of how I spent the couple of hours after the upgrade, but here’s a summary:
  <ul>
<li>Apache broke because when Ubuntu upgraded PHP from 7.4 to 8.1 Apache’s configuration files weren’t updated to point to the new version of PHP.</li>
<li>phpMyAdmin and Emacs were both removed. I’m not sure why but it could have something to do with each of them having been originally installed as part of a bundle (LAMP in the case of phpMyAdmin and Git in the case of Emacs) instead of through the standard installation process. If this hypothesis is correct then reinstalling the packages individually should resolve the issue.</li> 
<li>MySQL is a package that breaks on every upgrade and I have to admit that I bear part of the responsibility for that. Shortly after installing it for the first time I did a lot of half-ignorant mucking about with the configuration files to get it to work, and it became a tradition for every OS upgrade afterwards to trip over one of the changes I made at the time. Fortunately, the changes are easy to spot and revert with the aid of the error messages.</li>
</ul>
 </p>
<p>Based on this year’s experience, here are a few ways I can see of improving the upgrade process:
  <ul>
<li>Dependency management is in desperate need of improvement. If an old version of a package is replaced with a new one the configuration files in dependent packages must be automatically updated to reflect that fact. Conversely, if a dependent package is updated, the packages it depends on must be  checked for compatibility with the dependent package’s new version. All of this is obviously the OS’s responsibility, not the user’s.</li>
<li>The upgrade tool needs to become better at updating software that’s been installed as part of a bundle. If not, then the user installing the bundle should be warned that he needs to reinstall the packages individually in order for the upgrade tool (or package manager) to properly deal with them.</li>
<li>Someone in the UI development team needs a kick in the ass.</li>

<h2><a href="posts/left-click.html">No Left-Click For You</a></h2>

<p>A few days ago a software update on Ubuntu broke the left-click functionality on my touch pad. This is how it happened and how I fixed it.</p>
<p>It all started in the morning when I ran <i>sudo apt update</i>, and upon discovering that there were no less than 48 packages waiting to be upgraded I ran <i>sudo apt upgrade</i>. I didn’t pay much attention during the upgrade process but, as you’ll see later, that wouldn’t have made a difference. This is a virtual machine that I mostly use for development work, but all I did afterwards was browse a couple of websites and then shut it down.</p> 
<p>Later, whilst sipping my coffee, I powered up the machine to get some work done. However, when the log in screen appeared I discovered that clicking on the account section didn’t make the password field appear. I then tried clicking on the menu bar options at the top, but nothing happened. Moving the cursor over the GUI elements activates hover effects and reveals tool tips, but clicking was useless. I let out a sigh, rolled up my metaphorical sleeves, and set to work.<p>
<p>I began the troubleshooting process, conventionally enough, by performing a reboot. I had access neither to the <i>Power Off</i> option in the menu nor to the command line, so I performed a shutdown using VirtualBox’s <i>ACPI Shutdown</i> feature (<strong>EDIT:</strong> It slipped my mind at the time that you can access the terminal before logging in and log in or perform a shut down from there). When I powered on the machine again I discovered that the problem hasn’t been solved. But this time, unlike before, it occurred to me to click on the “<i>Not listed?</i>” link, and to my surprise the username prompt appeared. I promptly entered my username and password and logged in.</p> 
<p>I clicked around the desktop, but the only additional piece of information I gained was that the right-click functioned normally, showing context menus wherever it should. I concluded that, with the odd exception of the “<i>Not listed?</i>” link mentioned before, nothing in the GUI responds to left-clicks.</p>    
<p>The obvious next step was to fire up the terminal, something which, of course, had to be done using the keyboard. I was practically certain that one or more of this morning’s updated packages was responsible for the current state of affairs, so I began my investigation by running <i>sudo apt update</i>, thinking that if a package hadn’t been installed properly it might be listed as available. But the result was negative: no updates were available.</p> 
<p>The next step was to dig deeper and examine the package manager’s log file. A bit of googling (on my phone of course) informed me that the file was at <i>/var/log/dpkg.log</i>. I used the <i>grep</i> command to retrieve a list of installed packages from the log file and filter them by date, and redirected the output to a new file. Examining the file showed that of the 48 packages installed this morning, 42 failed to install properly (i.e. had records listing “half-installed” as status). The records also showed that many of the “half-installed” packages were successfully reinstalled afterwards (i.e. each one had an additional record listing “installed” as status), so the next step was to ascertain which, if any, of the packages had a “half-installed” record without having a corresponding “installed” record.</p> 
<p>I used <i>grep</i> twice again on the log file, sending each group of “installed” and “half-installed” records to a separate file. And to make the upcoming comparison job easier I used the <i>sort</i> command to sort each file’s contents by package name. I then opened each file in a separate tab and began checking the “half-installed” records against the “installed” records. But the result was again negative: every single package with a “half-installed” record had a corresponding “installed” record.</p> 
<p>By now the package manager has twice assured me that the morning’s packages were properly updated. But I wasn’t buying it. It was time to closely examine the purpose of each one of the 42 reinstalled packages. I noticed that of the 7 packages directly related to the system’s GUI, 5 were specifically related to the display server. Four of the updates were to Xserver’s packages while the fifth was to the XWayland package. I don’t know much about display servers but I knew that GUI applications rely on them to function properly. I also knew that Ubuntu was transitioning from Xserver to Wayland, and a bit of googling informed me that XWayland is a compatibility layer used to run Xserver applications on Wayland. Now, for all I knew, any of these 5 packages could have caused the issue, but since my past experience with Wine had left me biased against compatibility software I decided to start with the XWayland package. Sure enough, as soon as I reinstalled the package, the left-click functionality returned.</p>
<p>While dealing with this incident I learned some interesting bits of technical information. But as far as the larger picture was concerned it only confirmed what I already knew:
<ul>
<li>Never trust the package manager.</li>
<li>The command line is awesome.</li>
<li>“Year of Linux on the Desktop” my ass.</li>
</ul>
